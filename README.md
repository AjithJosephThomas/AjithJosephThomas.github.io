The functionalities mentioned in the test are met to the best of my understanding. 

Improvements:
1)Bootstrap-sass.
2)Bootswatch-sass for theming.
3)Masonary layout.
4)Normalisation.
5)Transitions for views.


What is pending:
1) Refactor code with redux-saga as the middleware would be a better suite.
2) Improve infinite scroll to load relevant set of data that merging.
3) Improve normalisation for more detailed schema.
4) Filter based on title/name
